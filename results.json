    "hybrid_answer": "Machine Guarding Protection for WorkersProtection for Workers Overview Each piece of machinery has its own unique mechanical and non-mechanical hazards. Machines can cause a variety of injuries ranging from minor abrasions, burns or cuts to severe injuries such as fractures, laceraƟons, crushing injuries or even amputa Ɵon. Machine guards are your ﬁrst line of defense against injuries caused by machine operaƟon. Each machine must have adequate safeguards to protect operators and other employees in the immediate work area from hazards created by ingoing nip points, rota Ɵng parts, sparks and ﬂ ying debris. Pinch points and shear points would include power transmission apparatuses such as: ﬂywheels, pulleys, belts, chains, couplings, spindles, cams, gears, connecƟng rods and other machine components that transmit energy. Having an understanding of how a machine works, and how the guards can protect you, will result in a reduced risk of injury. As an employee you may become accustomed to doing things in a certain way or have tasks ﬂ owing a certain way and grow oblivious to the hazards that may be ever present around your piece of equipment. With complacency there is a sense of numbness that develops to hazards. Employees must be on guard and not become complacent in the workplace. All guards should: PREVENT CONTACT – machine guards must provide a physical barrier that prevents the operator from having any part of his/her body in the “danger zone” during the machine’s operaƟ ng cycle; BE SECURED IN PLACE – machine guards must be secure and strong so that workers are not able to bypass, remove, or tamper with them. CREATE NO NEW HAZARD – A safeguard defeats its own purpose if it creates a hazard of its own such as a shear point, a jagged edge, or an unﬁnished surface which can cause a laceraƟon. If possible, one should be able to lubricate the machine without removing safeguards. NOT INTERFERE WITH THE MACHINE OPERATION – Any safeguard which impedes a worker from performing the job quickly and comfortably might soon be overridden or disregarded. Proper safeguarding can actually enhance eﬃciency since it can relieve the worker’s apprehensions about injury. Hazardous Mechanical Motions: HAZARDOUS MOTIONS – including rotaƟng machine parts, reciproca Ɵng moƟons (sliding parts or up/down moƟons), and transverse moƟ ons (materials moving in a con Ɵ nuous line); POINTS OF OPERATION – the areas where the machine cuts, shapes, bores, or bends the stock being fed through it; PINCH POINTS AND SHEAR POINTS –the area where a part of the body or clothing could be caught betweena moving part and a sta Ɵ onary object. There are also non-mechanical hazards that can injure machine operators or personnel working in the vicinity of machinery. These hazards include ﬂ ying splinters, chips or debris; splashes, sparks or sprays that are created when the machine is opera Ɵng. These hazards can be prevented through the use of machine guarding and wearing/ use of required personal protec Ɵve equipment (PPE). Address, City, State Zip Code -0000  (877) 555-5555  www.website.com Methods of Safegaurding There are ﬁve (5) general types of machine safeguards that can be used to protect workers and personnel in the immediate vicinity of machinery. 1. Guards – these are physical barriers that prevent contact. They can be ﬁ xed, interlocked, adjustable, or self-adjus Ɵng. 2. Devices – these limit or prevent access to the hazardous area.These can be presence-sensingdevices, pullback or restraintstraps, safety trip controls, two-hand controls, or gates. 3. Automated Feeding and Ejec Ɵon Mechanisms – These eliminatethe operator’s exposure to thepoint of opera Ɵon while handling materials. 4. Machine Loca Ɵon or Distance – this method removes the hazardfrom the operator’s work area. 5. Miscellaneous Aids – these methods can be used to protectboth operators and peoplein the immediate vicinity ofoperaƟng machinery. Examples include shields to contain chips,sparks, sprays or other forms ofﬂying debris; holding tools thatan operator can use to handlematerials going into the point ofoperaƟon; and awareness barriers to warn people about hazards inthe area.

    "hybrid_answer": "A GUIDE TO THE MACHINERY REGULATION (EU) 2023/1230 Key changes and challenges As the “go to” document for machine builders, the European machinery directive lays out the minimum safety requirements for machinery. The last change to the directive was on 29 December 2009, when 2006/42/EC was introduced. In 2020, as part of the commission work program ‘A Europe fit for the Digital Age’, the Machinery Directive underwent an impact assessment, and it was concluded that a number of gaps required addressing – namely (i) tackling new risks originating from emerging technologies; (ii) legal uncertainty on scope definitions; (iii) insufficient provisions for high-risk machines; (iv) adoption of digital documentation; and (vi) divergences in transposition interpretation. As the implementation date draws closer, it is important for OEM/ machine builders to understand the key changes and challenges. What is the impact on OEMs? For OEMs exporting or selling equipment in the EU this will replace the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC. It highlights: • A new compliance route • A revised structure to the annexes to improve the flow • Additional requirements added into the essential health and safety requirements • Digital documentation • Cybersecurity requirements 1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1230/ojThe Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/12301 2The Machinery Regulation (EU) PG 2Key Dates PG 3Re-ordering of the annexes PG 4Substantial Modifications PG 9Compliance Route/ Fines & Penalties PG 10OEM - Call to Action PG 11Further Information PG 12 JULY 2026 First report by the member states that assesses the effectiveness of Articles 6(4) and (5) OCTOBER 2026 Member States must notify the European Commission of their penalty rules and measures.Key dates The new Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 was published in the official journal on 29 June 2023, and entered into force on 19 July 2023, with a 42-month transition to the application date of 20 January 2027. This date is the same for all EU and EFTA countries; and being a regulation and not a directive means it will be adopted at the same time with no modification. After 20 January 2027, all machinery and related products will need to meet the requirements of the new regulation before being placed on the market. The key changes to the new machinery regulation include a reordering of the annexes from the current machinery directive 2006/42/EC, a focus on changing technologies, and the threat from cybersecurity breaches. It is the first regulation to tie together machinery safety and cybersecurity.JUNE 2023 Publication of Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 in the Official Journal.

Autonomous mobile machinery (Clause 3.6.3.3) gains extra requirements, which are included in annex III and the supplementary essential health and safety requirements to offset risks due to the mobility of machinery or related products. Protection against corruption (Clause 1.1.9) introduces cyber security requirements related to OT (Operational Technology) and has been added to cover the increase in industrial networks for safety systems, and also the generation of data to support the growth of connected enterprise solutions. It covers both hardware and software requirements. Machinery needs to ensure that the connection of another device – either locally or remotely – doesn’t lead to a hazardous situation. In addition, any hardware component that transmits signals or data and has access to software that is critical for the machinery’s compliance to relevant health and safety requirements, needs to be protected against both accidental or intentional corruption, and will collect evidence of both legitimate or illegitimate interventions. Finally, for protection against corruption, software and data that are critical for the compliance of the machinery or related products with the relevant health and safety requirements, shall be identified as such and shall be adequately protected against accidental or intentional corruption. The machinery or related product shall identify the software installed on it that is necessary for it to operate safely; and shall be able to provide that information at all times in an easily accessible form. The machinery or related product shall collect evidence of a legitimate or illegitimate intervention in the software or a modification of the software installed on the machinery or related product or its configuration. 7The Machinery Regulation (EU) PG 2Key Dates PG 3Re-ordering of the annexes PG 4Substantial Modifications PG 9Compliance Route/ Fines & Penalties PG 10OEM - Call to Action PG 11Further Information PG 12 8Additional requirements have been included for control systems. Safety and reliability of control systems (Clause 1.2.1) Control systems shall be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent hazardous situations from occuring. They also should withstand where appropriate to the circumstances and risks, the intended operating stresses and intended and unintended external influences, including reasonably foreseeable malicious attempts from third parties leading to a hazardous situation. It’s here that the link between safety and cybersecurity is evident. There is also the need for a tracing log containing the data generated in relation to an intervention, and of the versions of the safety software uploaded after the machinery or related product has been placed on the market or put into service. This needs to be enabled for five years after such an upload. The requirement here is exclusively to demonstrate the conformity of the machinery or the related product with this EHSRs should a reasonable request from a competent national authority be made. For OEMs developing control systems or logic with fully or partially self-evolving behavior, that are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, additional requirements have been added into the EHSRs in Annex III. They shall not cause the machinery or related product to perform actions beyond their defined task and movement space. Recording of data on the safety related decision-making process for software-based safety systems ensuring safety functions must be enabled and retained for one year after the machinery or related product is place on to the market or put into service. At all times it must be possible to correct the machinery or related product in order to maintain its inherent safety. 8The Machinery Regulation (EU) PG 2Key Dates PG 3Re-ordering of the annexes PG 4Substantial Modifications PG 9Compliance Route/ Fines & Penalties PG 10OEM - Call to Action PG 11Further Information PG 12 Substantial modifications – explanation of Article 3 (16) After being placed on the market or put into service, should machinery be modified, by physical or digital means (meaning hardware or software), in a way that is not foreseen by the manufacturer, and which affects the safety of such products by creating a new hazard or increasing an existing risk, the modification should be considered as substantial when significant new protective measures are required . The person that carries out the substantial modification should be required to perform a new conformity assessment before placing the modified product on the market or putting it into service. This conformity assessment can be restricted to the part of the production line that has been modified, and so does not have to be completed for the whole assembly.

However, self- certification is still possible as long as the machinery is in Annex I Part B and is built preferably using harmonized standards or a common specification. If the machinery is not in Annex I, the preferred route is to follow harmonized standards. The compliance route for this type of equipment is in Annex VI module A. For all other equipment, third-party certification through a notified body is required. The route to compliance is covered in Annexes VII VIII & IX of the Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/12302. 2 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R1230 Fines & Penalties Article 50 empowers member states to define the exact size of the fines and penalties against the Machinery Regulations (EU) 2023/1230. Although not yet confirmed it is expected that these will aligned with other recent directives, such as the Network & Information Security Directive (NIS2) which can impose fines of up to €10,000,000 or 2% of global annual revenue.

    "hybrid_answer": "Specific Machine Hazards and Safeguarding Methods As discussed earlier, 8,450 known non-fatal ampu- tation cases (involving days away from work)occurred in 2005 for all of private industry. Themost prevalent injury source was, by far, machin-ery, which accounted for approximately 60% (5,080instances) of the amputation cases. 1The machinery listed here cause amputation injuries, and appropri-ate safeguarding and hazardous energy control(lockout/tagout) methods are addressed in this sec-tion. Employers need to consult the OSHA standardfor specific machinery to ensure compliance withall requirements. For other types of hazardoussources of injury, see Appendix B. Machinery Associated with Amputations 1. Mechanical Power Presses 2. Power Press Brakes3. Powered and Non-Powered Conveyors4. Printing Presses5. Roll-Forming and Roll-Bending Machines6.

Slitters Hazards of Mechanical Power Presses Although there are three major types of powerpresses—mechanical, hydraulic, and pneumatic—the machinery that accounts for a large number ofworkplace amputations are mechanical powerpresses. In mechanical power presses, tools or dies are mounted on a slide, or ram, which operates in acontrolled, reciprocating motion toward and awayfrom the stationary bed or anvil containing thelower die. When the upper and lower dies presstogether – to punch, shear or form – the work-piece, the desired piece is produced. Once thedownstroke is completed, the re-formed work-piece 20 Occupational Safety and Health Administrationtenance program needs to be established based upon the: • Manufacturer’s recommendations; • Good engineering practice; and• Any applicable OSHA provisions (such as the mechanical power press inspection and mainte-nance requirements, contained in 1910.217(e)). Lockout/Tagout OSHA’s lockout/tagout (LOTO) standard, 29 CFR1910.147, establishes minimum performance re-quirements for controlling hazardous energy and itis intended to complement and augment machinesafeguarding practices. The lockout/tagout standardapplies only if employees are exposed to hazard-ous energy during servicing/maintenance activities.An employer may avoid the requirements of theLOTO standard if the safeguarding method elimi- nates your employees’ exposure to the machine danger area during the servicing or maintenancework by using Machinery and Machine Guardingmethods in accordance with the requirements con-tained in 29 CFR 1910, Subpart O. Additionally, because some minor servicing may have to be performed during normal productionoperations, an employer may be exempt fromLOTO in some instances. Minor tool changes andadjustments and other minor servicing operations,which take place during normal production opera-tions, are not covered by lockout/tagout if they areroutine, repetitive and integral to the use of themachine for production and if work is performedusing alternative effective protective measures thatprovide effective employee protection. In short, a hazardous energy control program is a critical part of an overall strategy to preventworkplace amputations during machine servicingand maintenance activities, such as during the set-ting up of machines for production purposes, by-passing guards to clear jams or lubricate parts, andinspecting, adjusting, replacing, or otherwise serv-icing machine parts. Machine amputations occurwhen an employer does not have or fails to imple-ment practices and procedures to disable and con-trol a machine’s energy sources during machineservicing and maintenance work. 1U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS); Annual Survey data, Table R25.

(See Figure 23 .) Figure 23 Part Revolution Mechanical Power Press with a T wo-Hand Control Controls for Machines with Clutches Certain machines can be categorized based on the type of clutch they use—full-revolution orpart-revolution. Differing modes of operation forthese two clutches determine the type of guard-ing that can be used. Full-revolution clutches, once activated, com- plete a full cycle of the slide (lowering and rais-ing of the slide) before stopping at dead centerand cannot be disengaged until the cycle is com-plete. So, presence-sensing devices will notwork and operators must be protected duringthe entire press operating cycle. For example,properly applied barrier guards or two-handtrip devices that are installed at a safe distancefrom the hazard area may be used. Machines incorporating full-revolution clutches, such as mechanical power presses,must also incorporate a single-stroke device andanti-repeat feature. The majority of part-revolution presses are air clutch and brake. They are designed to trapair in a chamber or tube. When the compressedair is put into these chambers, the clutch isengaged, the brake disengaged and the press makes a single stroke. To stop the press, the reverse takes place. Thus, the part-revolutionclutch can be disengaged at any time during thecycle to stop the cycle before it completes thedownstroke. For safeguarding purposes, part-revolution mechanical power presses can be equipped withpresence-sensing devices, but full-revolutionmechanical power presses cannot. NOTE: Likewise, most hydraulic power presses and their associated control systems are similar topart-revolution mechanical power presses in thatthe slide can be stopped at any point in the cycle.In order to ensure the integrity of the safety-relatedfunctions, safeguarding devices (such as presence-sensing devices) may only be used on hydraulicpower presses that are properly designed and con-structed (in accordance with good engineeringpractice) to accommodate the safeguarding system.Refer to OSHA’s Machine Guarding eTool for addi-tional information on hydraulic presses. Amputations occurring from the point of opera- tion hazards are the most common types of injuriesassociated with mechanical power presses.Improperly applied safeguarding methods (such asusing a guard with more than maximum allowableopenings or 2-hand palm buttons that are mountedwithin the safety distance of the press) may allowoperators unsafe access to the press’s hazardousarea. These unsafe conditions may result in anamputation when an operator, for example, instinc-tively reaches into the point of operation to adjust amisaligned part or release a jam. Also, amputationsoccur when an operator’s normal feeding rhythm isinterrupted, resulting in inadvertent placement of theoperator’s hands in the point of operation. Suchinjuries usually happen while the operator is ridingthe foot pedal. Additionally, some amputations arelinked to mechanical (such as the failure of a single-stroke linkage), electrical (such as a control relay fail-ure), or pneumatic (such as the loss of air pressureto the clutch/brake) machine component failure. Examples of inadequate or ineffective safe- guarding and hazardous energy control practicesinclude the following: • Guards and devices disabled to increase produc- tion, to allow the insertion of small-piece work, orto allow better viewing of the opera tion. • Two-hand trips/controls bridged or tied-down to allow initiation of the press cycle using only onehand. • Devices such as pullbacks or restraints improp- erly adjusted. SAFEGUARDING EQUIPMENT AND PROTECTING EMPLOYEES FROM AMPUTATIONS 21 Control Box Control BoxLight Curtain • Controls of a single-operator press bypassed by having a coworker activate the controls whilethe operator positions or aligns parts in the die,or repairs or troubleshoots the press. • Failure to properly disable, isolate press energy sources, and lockout/tagout presses before anemployee performs servicing or maintenancework. Case History #1 While using an unguarded, foot-pedal-operated,full-revolution mechanical power press thatmade trip collars for wood stoves, an employeeused his hands to feed and remove finished partsand scrap metal. He placed the completed part tothe left side of the press, and then turned toplace the scrap in the bin behind him. As heturned back to face the press, he inadvertentlystepped on the foot pedal and activated the presswhile his hand was in the die area. His left handwas amputated at the wrist. Case History #2 An employee was operating an unguarded 10-ton, full-revolution mechanical power press tostamp mailbox parts, and using a hand tool toload the press, she placed her left hand in thelower die to reposition a misaligned part. At thesame time, she inadvertently depressed the footpedal, activating the press and crushing her leftindex finger. Case History #3 A power press operator and helper were instruc-ted to temporarily halt production and eachemployee decided to perform servicing tasks.The operator had a problem with a hydraulicfluid leak and decided to deflect the liquid sprayby installing a temporary barrier while, at thesame time, the helper decided to clean up themetal chips from the press area. The operatorthen activated the press and repositioned thepress slide in order to install the cardboard barri-er. This mechanical power press action fatally crushed the helper’s head because his head wasbetween the dies while he was in the process ofcleaning up the metal chips.

Safeguarding Mechanical Power Presses Mechanical power presses are extremely versatileand selecting appropriate safeguarding methodsdepends on the specific press design and use. Youshould consider the press, the type of clutch used, 22 Occupational Safety and Health Administrationthe stock size, the length of production runs, and the method of feeding. You can use primary safeguarding methods, such as guards or safeguarding devices, to preventinjuries. For example, 29 CFR 1910.217 requiresemployers to provide and ensure the use of pointof operation guards or properly installed devices onevery operation performed on a press when the dieopening is greater than 1/4inch. In addition, guards must conform to the maxi- mum permissible openings of Table O-10 of 29 CFR1910.217. Guards must prevent entry of hands orfingers into the point of operation through, over,under, or around the guard.

Mechanical power press point of operation safe- guards must accomplish the following goals: • Prevent or stop the normal press stroke if the operator’s hands are in the point of operation;or • Prevent the operator from reaching into the point of operation as the die closes; or • Withdraw the operator’s hands if inadvertently placed in the point of operation as the die clos-es; or • Prevent the operator from reaching the point of operation at any time; or • Require the operator to use both hands for the machine controls that are located at such a dis-tance that the slide completes the downwardtravel or stops before the operator can reachinto the point of operation; or • Enclose the point of operation before a press stroke can be started to prevent the operatorfrom reaching into the danger area before die closure or enclose the point of operation priorto stoppage of the slide motion during thedownward stroke. Source: 29 CFR 1910.217(c)(3)(i). Figure 24 Hand-Feeding T ools Used in Conjunction with Pullbacks on a Power Press • Removing scrap or stuck work with tools is required even when hand feeding is allowedaccording to 29 CFR 1910.217(d)(1)(ii). Em-ployers must furnish and enforce the use ofhand tools for freeing or removing work orscrap pieces from the die to reduce the amountof time an operator’s hand is near the point ofoperation. • Control point of operation hazards created when guards are removed for set-up and repair byoperating the machine in the inch mode. Thisinvolves using two-hand controls (or a singlecontrol mounted at a safe distance from themachine hazards) to gradually inch the pressthrough a stroke when the dies are being testedon part-revolution clutch presses. • Observe energy control procedures and prac- tices for press servicing and maintenance work.For example, the changing of dies on a mechan-ical power press requires the employer to estab-lish a die-setting procedure that employs point-of-operation safeguarding method(s) such as thesafe usage of an inch or jogsafety device for die set-up purposes together with LOTO. Thesedevices safely position the mechanical powerpress slide utilizing a point-of-operation safe-guarding technique. Thus, an energy controlprocedure for these types of presses would SAFEGUARDING EQUIPMENT AND PROTECTING EMPLOYEES FROM AMPUTATIONS 23“No Hands-in-Die” Policy In general, a “no-hands-in-die” policy needs to be implemented and followed whenever possible– that is, in the event the press is not designedfor “hands-in-die” production work. Under thispolicy, operators must never place their hands inthe die area (point-of-operation) while perform-ing normal production operations. Adherence tothis safety practice will reduce the risk of point ofoperation amputations. In terms of part-revolution mechanical power presses that use a two-hand control, presence-sensing device or type B gate, OSHA does allow “hands-in-die” operation if the press control reli-ability and brake monitoring system require-ments are met. If these press design safety fea-tures are not complied with, then employersmust incorporate a “no-hands-in-die” policy. Source: 29 CFR 1910.217(c)(5). Other Controls for Mechanical Power Press Servicing and Maintenance Secondary safeguarding methods may be used alone or in combination (to achieve near equivalentprotection) only when the employer can show thatit is impossible to use any of the primary safe-guarding methods. The following are some workpractices, complementary equipment and energycontrol measures that may be used to supplementprimary safeguarding: • If employees operate presses under a “no- hands-in-die” policy using complementary feed-ing methods such as hand-tool feeding, employ-ers still must protect operators through the useof primary safeguarding methods, such as aproperly applied two-hand control or trip safe-guarding device. Hand-tool feeding alone doesnot ensure that the operator’s hands cannotreach the danger area. ( Figure 24 illustrates the use of hand-feeding tools in conjunction withpullbacks on a power press.) Ram Up-Die Open Ram Descending-Die Closing need to integrate both point-of-operation safe- guarding method(s) for slide positioning as wellas LOTO procedures for the die setting opera-tion. Additional power press energy control precau- tions (e.g., use of safety blocks; LOTO the press dis-connect switch if re-energization presents a hazard)will be necessary if employees need to place theirhands/arms in a press working area (the spacebetween the bolster plate and the ram/slide) toperform the servicing and/or maintenance activity(such as adjusting, cleaning or repairing dies) be-cause the inch or jogsafety device will not pro tect employees from ram movement due to potentialmechanical energy (resulting from the ram/slideposition and associated gravitational force), presscomponent or control system malfunction, or pressactivation by others. Minor Servicing At times, OSHA recognizes that some minor servicing may have to be performed during nor-mal production operations, so a lockout/tagoutexception is allowed. See the 29 CFR 1910.147(a)(2)(ii) Note for details. For example, a press oper-ator may need to perform a minor die cleaningtask on a regular basis for product quality pur-poses and the use of safety blocks – insertedbetween the press dies – that are interlocked withthe press electrical controls would constituteeffective protection. Properly designed andapplied safety block interlocks may be used inlieu of locking or tagging out the press’s electricalenergy source for purposes of the minor servic-ing exception. Source: 29 CFR 1910.147(a)(2)(ii) Note. Training Training is essential for employee protection. As anemployer, you should: • Train operators in safe mechanical press opera- tion and hazardous energy control (lockout/tagout) procedures and techniques before theybegin work on the press. • Supervise operators to ensure that correct pro- cedures and techniques are being followed. Additional Requirements In addition, work practices such as regular mechan-ical power press inspection, maintenance, andreporting are essential.• 29 CFR 1910.217(e)(1)(i) requires a program of periodic and regular inspections of mechanicalpower presses to ensure that all of the pressparts, auxiliary equipment and safeguards arein safe operating condition and adjustment.Inspection certification records must be main-tained. • 29 CFR 1910.217(e)(1)(ii) requires you to inspect and test the condition of the clutch/brake mech-anism, anti-repeat feature, and single-strokemechanism on at least a weekly basis for press-es without control reliability and brake systemmonitoring. Certification records must be main-tained of these inspections and the maintenanceperformed. • 29 CFR 1910.217(g)(1) requires the reporting of all point of operation injuries to operators or other employees within 30 days to either theDirector of the Directorate of Standards andGuidance, OSHA, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210, or the state agency administering a plan approved by OSHA.

Pressbrake operation is either mechanical or hydraulic. Press brakes are either general-purpose or spe- cial-purpose brakes, according to ANSI B11.3-2002,Safety Requirements for Power Press Brakes . General purpose press brakes have a single opera-tor control station. A servo-system activates thespecial purpose brake, which may be equippedwith multiple operator/helper control stations. (SeeFigure 25 for a power press brake operation.) Figure 25 Power Press Brake Bending Metal Hazards of Power Press Brakes As with mechanical power presses, point of opera- tion injuries are the most common type of injuryassociated with power press brakes. Here are somefrequent causes of amputations from power pressbrakes: • Foot controls being inadvertently activated while the operator’s hand is in the point of operation.The likelihood of this type of injury increases asthe size of stock decreases and brings the opera-tor’s hands closer to the point of operation. • Parts of the body caught in pinch points created between the stock and the press brake framewhile the bend is being made. • Controls of a single-operator press bypassed by having a coworker activate the controls while SAFEGUARDING EQUIPMENT AND PROTECTING EMPLOYEES FROM AMPUTATIONS 25the operator positions or aligns stock or repairs or troubleshoots the press. • Failure to properly lockout/tagout presses during the necessary tasks of making adjustments,clearing jams, performing maintenance,installing or aligning dies, or cleaning themachine. Case History #4 An operator was bending small parts using an80-ton unguarded press brake. This required theemployee’s fingers to be very close to the pointof operation; and, consequently, the operator lostthree fingers when his hand entered the pointof operation. The operator on the previous shifthad reported to the supervisor that the opera-tor placed his fingers close to the point of opera- tion, but was told that nothing could be done andthat the operator should be careful. Case History #5 An operator was bending metal parts using a 36-ton part-revolution power press brake that wasfoot-activated and equipped with a light curtain.About 3-4 inches of the light curtain had been“blanked out” during a previous part run. Whileadjusting a part at the point of operation, theemployee accidentally activated the foot pedaland amputated three fingertips. Safeguarding Power Press Brakes Primary safeguarding methods, such as physicalguards and point of operation safeguarding devices(movable barrier devices, presence-sensing de-vices, pull-back devices, restraint devices, single-and two-hand devices) can be used to effectivelyguard power press brakes. ( Figure 26 shows a gen- eral-purpose power press brake used in conjunc-tion with pullbacks.) Some safeguarding methods,such as presence-sensing devices, may requiremuting or blanking to allow the bending of materi-al. Always ensure that these safety devices areproperly installed, maintained, and used in accor-dance with the manufacturer’s guidelines for thespecific stock and task to be performed. Failure todo so could leave sensing field channels \"blankedout\" and expose operators to point-of-operation hazards as the safeguarding device’s safety dis-tance increases when blanking is used. Press BedPoint of Operation Figure 26 T wo-Person Power Press Brake Operation with Pullbacks In other instances, such as with special-purpose power press brakes, machines are equipped withadvanced control systems that are adaptable to allforms of safeguarding concepts and devices, suchas two-hand controls and multiple operator/helperactuating controls. For example, two-hand down, foot through (actuation) methods are used to safe- guard employees while they operate press brakes.With this safeguarding system, an operator uses atwo-hand control to lower the press brake ram, forexample, to within 1/4inch or less of the lower die (which is considered a safe opening). The operatorthen has the ability to maneuver and align thework-piece within this 1/4inch safe opening area and he or she is protected from the amputationhazard. Then the foot control is used by the opera-tor to safely actuate the machine to produce thedesired product. Because of constraints imposed by certain man- ufacturing or fabricating processes, safeguardingby maintaining a safe distance from the point of operation may be acceptable. However, this is per-mitted only when safeguarding by barrier guardor safeguarding devices is not feasible (impossi-ble) – that is, where the use of primary safeguard-ing method (such as a restraint device) is not fea-sible. Additional information about a safe distance safeguarding program can be found in OSHA Instruction 02-01-025 [CPL 2-1.25] – Guidelines for Point of Operation Guarding of Power PressBrakes. 26 Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationOther Controls for Power Press Brakes The following are some secondary safeguarding methods and complementary equipment that maybe used to supplement primary safeguarding oralone or in combination when primary safeguard-ing methods are not feasible: • Safe distance safeguarding, • Safe holding safeguarding,• Safe work procedures,• Work-holding equipment (such as back gauges),• Properly designed and protected foot pedals, and • Hand-feeding tools. Ensure that proper safeguarding and lockout/ tagout procedures are developed and implementedfor power press brakes. Train and supervise em-ployees in these procedures and conduct periodicinspections to ensure compliance.

Many conveyors have different andunique features and uses, so that hazards vary due WristletsPoint of OperationPress Bed to the material conveyed, the location of the con- veyor, and the proximity of the conveyer to theemployees. Types include unpowered and pow-ered, live roller, slat, chain, screw, and pneumatic.Conveyors eliminate or reduce manual materialhandling tasks, but they present amputation haz-ards associated with mechanical motion. (SeeFigures 27 through 30 for examples of common conveyors.) Conveyor-related injuries typically involve a employee’s hands or fingers becoming caught innip points or shear points on conveyors and mayoccur in these situations: • Cleaning and maintaining a conveyor, especially when it is still operating. • Reaching into an in-going nip point to remove debris or to free jammed material. • Allowing a cleaning cloth or an employee’s clothing to get caught in the conveyor and pullthe employee’s fingers or hands into the con-veyor. Other conveyor-related hazards include improp- erly guarded gears, sprocket and chain drives, hori-zontal and vertical shafting, belts and pulleys, andpower transmission couplings. Overhead convey-ors warrant special attention because most of theconveyor’s drive train is exposed. Employees havealso been injured or killed while working in areasunderneath conveyors and in areas around lubrica-tion fittings, tension adjusters, and other equipmentwith hazardous energy sources. Case History #6 While removing a cleaning rag from the ingoingnip point between the conveyor belt and its tailpulley (the unpowered end of the conveyor), anemployee’s arm became caught in the pulley,which amputated his arm below the elbow. Case History #7 While servicing a chain-and-sprocket driveassembly on a roof tile conveyor system, anemployee turned off the conveyor, removed theguard, and began work on the drive assemblywithout locking out the system. When someonestarted the conveyor, the employee’s fingersbecame caught in the chain-and-sprocket driveand were amputated.

Where necessary for the protection of employees, conveyors need to havemechanical guards that protect the employee fromnip points, shear points, and other moving parts,including power-transmission apparatus. Guardsmay include barriers, enclosures, grating, fences, orother obstructions that prevent inadvertent physicalcontact with operating machine components, suchas point of operation areas, belts, gears, sprockets,chains, and other moving parts. A brief descriptionof the hazards and recognized safeguarding meth-ods is presented for common types of conveyors. T ypical Con veyor Hazards and Safeguarding Methods Belt Conveyors Hazards: Belt-conveyor drive mechanisms and conveying mediums are hazardous as are the fol-lowing belt-conveyor areas: 1) conveyor take-upand discharge ends; 2) where the belt or chainenters or exits the in-going nip point; 3) wherethe belt wraps around pulleys; 4) snub rollerswhere the belt changes direction, such as take-ups; 5) where multiple conveyors are adjoined;or 6) on transfers or deflectors used with beltconveyors. Controls: The hazards associated with nip and shear points must be safeguarded. Side guards(spill guards), if properly designed can preventemployee contact with power-transmission com-ponent, in-going nip points and the conveying medium. Secondary safeguarding methods for hazard control include the use of standard railingsor fencing, or safeguarding by distance (location),and installing hazard awareness devices, such aspre-start-up signals and warning signs. Screw Conveyors Hazards: Screw conveyors are troughs with a revolving longitudinal shaft on which a spiral ortwisted plate is designed. In-going nip points, ofturning helical flights for the entire length of thescrew conveyor, exist between the revolvingshaft and trough. Since the trough is not usuallyrequired to be covered for proper operation ofthe conveyor and because many screw convey-ors are located at or near the floor level, the haz-ard of stepping into the danger area is ever pres-ent. Once caught, the victim is pulled further intothe path of the conveying medium. Controls: A screw conveyor housing must com- pletely enclose the moving elements (screwmechanism, power transmission apparatus) ofthe conveyor, except for the loading and dis-charge points. Permanently affixed grids or poly-carbonate can be installed for visibility purposesto allow the operator to inspect the operation.Alternatively, the trough side walls should behigh enough to prevent employees from reach-ing over and falling into the trough. Opentroughs can be used if covers are not feasible;but employees need to be protected by second-ary safeguarding methods, such as a railing orfence. Feed loading and discharge points can usually be guarded by providing enclosures, screening,grating, or some other interruption across theopenings which will allow the passage of thematerial without allowing the entry of a part ofthe employee’s body into the moving part(s). Chain Conveyors Hazards: Nip points occur when a chain contacts a sprocket, such as when a chain runs around asprocket or when the chain is supported by asprocket or when a shoe above the chain pre-cludes the chain from lifting off the sprocket. Nippoints also occur at drives, terminals, take-ups(automatic take-ups may also have shear points),and idlers. Employee clothing, jewelry, and longhair may also get entangled and caught in themoving chain conveyor. 28 Occupational Safety and Health Administration Fixed Guard Over Power-T ransmissionApparatusIn-Running Nip Point Fixed Guard Slats Controls: Sometimes, moving chains cannot be enclosed without impairing the functioning of theconveyor. However, in some cases, barrierguards may be installed around the moving partsfor hazard enclosure purposes or, in other in-stances, nip and shear points may be eliminatedby placing a guard at the nip point or shearpoint. Other secondary safeguarding optionsinclude safeguarding by distance (location) andthe use of awareness devices. Roller Conveyors Hazards: Roller conveyors are used to move material on a series of parallel rollers that areeither powered or gravity-fed. Powered rollerconveyors have the hazard of snagging andpulling objects, including hands, hair, and cloth-ing into the area between the rollers and the sta-tionary components of the conveyor. In-goingnip points generally exist between the drivechain and sprockets; between belt and carrierrollers; and at terminals, drives, take-ups, idlers,and snub rollers. Controls: Roller conveyors need to, where feasi- ble, have permanent barrier guards that can beadjusted as necessary to protect the employeefrom nip and shear points. For example, theunused section of rollers closest to the employ-ees needs to be guarded when transportingsmall items on a roller conveyor that do notrequire the use of the entire roller width. Also,conveyor hazards may be reduced by eliminatingor minimizing projections from the roller andthrough the use of pop-up rollers. Other second-ary safeguarding options include safeguardingby distance (location) and the use of awarenessdevices. Other Controls for Con veyors The following are some secondary safeguarding methods, work practices, and complementaryequipment that may be used to supplement pri-mary safeguarding or alone or in combinationwhen primary safeguarding methods are not feasi-ble: • Safeguarding by safe distance (by location) — locating moving parts away from employees toprevent accidental contact with the hazardpoint—is one option for safeguarding convey-ors. It is particularly difficult, however, to usethis method when employees need to be at or near unguarded moving parts. • Use prominent awareness devices, such as warning signs or lights, to alert employees tothe conveyor operation. • Allow only trained individuals to operate con- veyors and only trained, authorized staff to per-form servicing and maintenance work. • Visually inspect the entire conveyor and imme- diate work area prior to start-up to determinethat the actuation will not cause an employeehazard. • Inspect and test conveyor safety mechanisms, such as its alarms, emergency stops, and safe-guarding methods. • Do not use any conveyor which is unsafe until it is made safe. • Forbid employees from riding on conveyors.• Prohibit employees working with or near con- veyors from wearing loose clothing or jewelry,and require them to secure long hair with a netor cap. • Install emergency stop devices on conveyors where employees work when they cannot other-wise control the movement of the conveyor.This recognized safety feature provides employ-ees with the means to shut off the equipment inthe event of a hazardous situation or emergencyincident. For emergency stop devices, you will need these engineering controls: • Equip conveyors with interlocking devices that shut them down during an electrical or mechani-cal overload such as product jam or other stop-page. Emergency devices need to be installed sothat they cannot be overridden from other loca-tions. • When conveyors are arranged in a series, all should automatically stop whenever one stops. • Equip conveyors with emergency stop controls that require manual resetting before resumingconveyor operation. • Install clearly marked, unobstructed emergency stop buttons or pull cords within easy reach ofemployees. • Provide continuously accessible conveyor belts with emergency stop cables that extend theentire length of the conveyor belt to allow access tothe cable from any point along the belt. • Ensure that conveyor controls or power sources can accept a lockout/tagout device to allow safemaintenance practices.

Printing presses are oftenpart of a larger system that also includes cutting,binding, folding, and finishing equipment. Manymodern printing presses rely on computer controls,and the high speeds of such equipment often re-quire rapid machine adjustments to avoid waste. This section discusses amputation hazards asso- ciated with two common types of printing presses:web-fed and sheet-fed printing press systems.Web-fed printing presses are fed by large continu-ous rolls of substrate such as paper, fabric orplastic; sheet-fed printing presses, as their name implies, are fed by large sheets of substrate. In bothtypes, the substrate typically feeds through a seriesof cylinders containing printing plates and support-ing cylinders moving in the opposite direction.(Figures 31 and 32 illustrate a roll-to-roll offset printing press and a sheet-fed offset printing press.) 30 Occupational Safety and Health Administration• Perform servicing and maintenance under an energy control program in accordance with theControl of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout) , 29 CFR 1910.147, standard. For example, instructemployees to lubricate, align, service, and main-tain conveyors when the conveyor is locked ortagged out if the task would expose them to anarea of the conveyor (or adjacent machinery)where hazardous energy exists. Minor Servicing At times, OSHA recognizes that some minor servicing may have to be performed during nor-mal production operations, so a lockout/tagoutexception is allowed. See the 29 CFR 1910.147(a)(2)(ii) Note for details. An example of a commonconveyor minor servicing activity involves pack-age jams where an employee must frequentlydislodge the jam. To prevent unexpected start-upof the conveyor, employers may adopt alterna-tive control measures, such as opening (placingin the off position) local disconnects or controlswitches to pr event conveyor start-up. These properly applied devices, if used, must beunder the exclusive control of the employee per- forming the jam release, so that no other personcan restart the conveyor without the knowledge and consent of the person performing the servic-ing work.

Safeguarding Printing Presses As with most machinery, you can rely on primarysafeguarding methods to protect employeesagainst injuries when using printing presses. Forexample, some primary safeguarding methodsinclude the following: • Install guards on all mechanical hazard points that are accessible during normal operation --such as accessible in-going nip points betweenrollers and power-transmission apparatus(chains and sprockets). • Safeguard nip point hazards with barrier guards or nip guards. Nip guards need to be designedand installed without creating additional haz-ards. • Install fixed barrier guards, with tamper-proof fasteners, at rollers that do not require operatoraccess. • Properly designed, applied, and maintained safeguarding devices (such as presence-sensingdevices and mats) may also be used to keepyour body out of machine danger areas. How-ever, these control circuit devices are no substi-tute for lockout/tagout. • Use hold-to-run controls (such as inch or re- verse) that protect employees from machinemechanical hazards by either: 1) requiring theuse of both hands for control initiation purpos-es; or 2) are mounted at a safe distance so thatan employee cannot inch or reverse the press SAFEGUARDING EQUIPMENT AND PROTECTING EMPLOYEES FROM AMPUTATIONS 31"

    "hybrid_answer": "Machine Guarding Protection for WorkersProtection for Workers Overview Each piece of machinery has its own unique mechanical and non-mechanical hazards. Machines can cause a variety of injuries ranging from minor abrasions, burns or cuts to severe injuries such as fractures, laceraƟons, crushing injuries or even amputa Ɵon. Machine guards are your ﬁrst line of defense against injuries caused by machine operaƟon. Each machine must have adequate safeguards to protect operators and other employees in the immediate work area from hazards created by ingoing nip points, rota Ɵng parts, sparks and ﬂ ying debris. Pinch points and shear points would include power transmission apparatuses such as: ﬂywheels, pulleys, belts, chains, couplings, spindles, cams, gears, connecƟng rods and other machine components that transmit energy. Having an understanding of how a machine works, and how the guards can protect you, will result in a reduced risk of injury. As an employee you may become accustomed to doing things in a certain way or have tasks ﬂ owing a certain way and grow oblivious to the hazards that may be ever present around your piece of equipment. With complacency there is a sense of numbness that develops to hazards. Employees must be on guard and not become complacent in the workplace. All guards should: PREVENT CONTACT – machine guards must provide a physical barrier that prevents the operator from having any part of his/her body in the “danger zone” during the machine’s operaƟ ng cycle; BE SECURED IN PLACE – machine guards must be secure and strong so that workers are not able to bypass, remove, or tamper with them. CREATE NO NEW HAZARD – A safeguard defeats its own purpose if it creates a hazard of its own such as a shear point, a jagged edge, or an unﬁnished surface which can cause a laceraƟon. If possible, one should be able to lubricate the machine without removing safeguards. NOT INTERFERE WITH THE MACHINE OPERATION – Any safeguard which impedes a worker from performing the job quickly and comfortably might soon be overridden or disregarded. Proper safeguarding can actually enhance eﬃciency since it can relieve the worker’s apprehensions about injury. Hazardous Mechanical Motions: HAZARDOUS MOTIONS – including rotaƟng machine parts, reciproca Ɵng moƟons (sliding parts or up/down moƟons), and transverse moƟ ons (materials moving in a con Ɵ nuous line); POINTS OF OPERATION – the areas where the machine cuts, shapes, bores, or bends the stock being fed through it; PINCH POINTS AND SHEAR POINTS –the area where a part of the body or clothing could be caught betweena moving part and a sta Ɵ onary object. There are also non-mechanical hazards that can injure machine operators or personnel working in the vicinity of machinery. These hazards include ﬂ ying splinters, chips or debris; splashes, sparks or sprays that are created when the machine is opera Ɵng. These hazards can be prevented through the use of machine guarding and wearing/ use of required personal protec Ɵve equipment (PPE). Address, City, State Zip Code -0000  (877) 555-5555  www.website.com Methods of Safegaurding There are ﬁve (5) general types of machine safeguards that can be used to protect workers and personnel in the immediate vicinity of machinery. 1. Guards – these are physical barriers that prevent contact. They can be ﬁ xed, interlocked, adjustable, or self-adjus Ɵng. 2. Devices – these limit or prevent access to the hazardous area.These can be presence-sensingdevices, pullback or restraintstraps, safety trip controls, two-hand controls, or gates. 3. Automated Feeding and Ejec Ɵon Mechanisms – These eliminatethe operator’s exposure to thepoint of opera Ɵon while handling materials. 4. Machine Loca Ɵon or Distance – this method removes the hazardfrom the operator’s work area. 5. Miscellaneous Aids – these methods can be used to protectboth operators and peoplein the immediate vicinity ofoperaƟng machinery. Examples include shields to contain chips,sparks, sprays or other forms ofﬂying debris; holding tools thatan operator can use to handlematerials going into the point ofoperaƟon; and awareness barriers to warn people about hazards inthe area.

If no product standard exists for your machine, important guidance is provided here. This Type A standard forms the basis for Type B and C standards. Target group Machine designers B and C standards makers and creators of factory standards. Essential points in brief The strategy for risk reduction is specified as follows: Perform a risk assessment by carrying out the following steps in the order given: • Determine limits and intended use of the machine. • Identify possible hazards and hazardous situations. • Assess the risk for every hazard or hazardous situation. • Evaluate risk and make decisions on the necessity of risk reduction. If the result of the risk assessment shows that risk reduction is necessary, protective measures must be taken according to the following “3-step method”. 1. Inherently safe design Choose suitable design features as principal measures for hazard removal: • No sharp corners or edges. • Observe minimum clearances from hazards. • Reduce forces, speeds and weights to safe values. • Design parts within the load limits. • Use intrinsically safe technologies such as safety extra-low voltage, non-toxic fluids in the hydraulics etc. • Mechanical restraint devices shall be given preference over solutions dependent on power when the transfer of movement is involved. • Ensure ergonomic features such as sufficient lighting and ergonomic operation. • Exclude hazardous behaviour of the machinery such as unexpected startups or uncontrolled speed changes by means of safe control system design. • Fault detection by means of redundant design • Minimize the work required in the danger zone through: –Reliability of machine functions – this reduces the frequency of the interventions required. –No manual loading and unloading of the machinery. –Setting and maintenance locations outside the danger zone. Take into account all “phases of the working life” of the machine: Construction, transport and commissioning, operation and implementation, decommissioning, dismantling and, when necessary, disposal. 2. Risk reduction by means of technical safeguards Technical protection measures must be applied if it is not possible to reduce the potential hazards by means of appropriate design features. Example 1: If access to the danger zone is not necessary during operation, close this area off by means of mechanical covers. EN 953 describes the requirements placed on “ guards”. Example 2: Ensure the following measures if the user must work in the danger zone: • Movable guard with monitoring feature. • Electro-sensitive protective equipment. • Two-hand control. The guards should remain functional when possible during maintenance and setting operations. If this is not possible, a lockable operating mode selector switch must be used. This should enable an operating mode of “reduced risk” such as creep speed to be selected manually. 3. User information concerning residual risk You were not able to remove all hazards satisfactorily by means of design measures or technical safeguards? Warn the user directly by means of clear indications in the operating instructions at the location of danger! Risk estimation and evaluation must be carried out after each of the three stages for risk reduction → figure 63, page 115. The way to a safe machine 12.3"

    "hybrid_answer": "A GUIDE TO THE MACHINERY REGULATION (EU) 2023/1230 Key changes and challenges As the “go to” document for machine builders, the European machinery directive lays out the minimum safety requirements for machinery. The last change to the directive was on 29 December 2009, when 2006/42/EC was introduced. In 2020, as part of the commission work program ‘A Europe fit for the Digital Age’, the Machinery Directive underwent an impact assessment, and it was concluded that a number of gaps required addressing – namely (i) tackling new risks originating from emerging technologies; (ii) legal uncertainty on scope definitions; (iii) insufficient provisions for high-risk machines; (iv) adoption of digital documentation; and (vi) divergences in transposition interpretation. As the implementation date draws closer, it is important for OEM/ machine builders to understand the key changes and challenges. What is the impact on OEMs? For OEMs exporting or selling equipment in the EU this will replace the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC. It highlights: • A new compliance route • A revised structure to the annexes to improve the flow • Additional requirements added into the essential health and safety requirements • Digital documentation • Cybersecurity requirements 1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1230/ojThe Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/12301 2The Machinery Regulation (EU) PG 2Key Dates PG 3Re-ordering of the annexes PG 4Substantial Modifications PG 9Compliance Route/ Fines & Penalties PG 10OEM - Call to Action PG 11Further Information PG 12 JULY 2026 First report by the member states that assesses the effectiveness of Articles 6(4) and (5) OCTOBER 2026 Member States must notify the European Commission of their penalty rules and measures.Key dates The new Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 was published in the official journal on 29 June 2023, and entered into force on 19 July 2023, with a 42-month transition to the application date of 20 January 2027. This date is the same for all EU and EFTA countries; and being a regulation and not a directive means it will be adopted at the same time with no modification. After 20 January 2027, all machinery and related products will need to meet the requirements of the new regulation before being placed on the market. The key changes to the new machinery regulation include a reordering of the annexes from the current machinery directive 2006/42/EC, a focus on changing technologies, and the threat from cybersecurity breaches.

Autonomous mobile machinery (Clause 3.6.3.3) gains extra requirements, which are included in annex III and the supplementary essential health and safety requirements to offset risks due to the mobility of machinery or related products. Protection against corruption (Clause 1.1.9) introduces cyber security requirements related to OT (Operational Technology) and has been added to cover the increase in industrial networks for safety systems, and also the generation of data to support the growth of connected enterprise solutions. It covers both hardware and software requirements. Machinery needs to ensure that the connection of another device – either locally or remotely – doesn’t lead to a hazardous situation. In addition, any hardware component that transmits signals or data and has access to software that is critical for the machinery’s compliance to relevant health and safety requirements, needs to be protected against both accidental or intentional corruption, and will collect evidence of both legitimate or illegitimate interventions. Finally, for protection against corruption, software and data that are critical for the compliance of the machinery or related products with the relevant health and safety requirements, shall be identified as such and shall be adequately protected against accidental or intentional corruption. The machinery or related product shall identify the software installed on it that is necessary for it to operate safely; and shall be able to provide that information at all times in an easily accessible form. The machinery or related product shall collect evidence of a legitimate or illegitimate intervention in the software or a modification of the software installed on the machinery or related product or its configuration. 7The Machinery Regulation (EU) PG 2Key Dates PG 3Re-ordering of the annexes PG 4Substantial Modifications PG 9Compliance Route/ Fines & Penalties PG 10OEM - Call to Action PG 11Further Information PG 12 8Additional requirements have been included for control systems. Safety and reliability of control systems (Clause 1.2.1) Control systems shall be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent hazardous situations from occuring. They also should withstand where appropriate to the circumstances and risks, the intended operating stresses and intended and unintended external influences, including reasonably foreseeable malicious attempts from third parties leading to a hazardous situation. It’s here that the link between safety and cybersecurity is evident. There is also the need for a tracing log containing the data generated in relation to an intervention, and of the versions of the safety software uploaded after the machinery or related product has been placed on the market or put into service. This needs to be enabled for five years after such an upload. The requirement here is exclusively to demonstrate the conformity of the machinery or the related product with this EHSRs should a reasonable request from a competent national authority be made. For OEMs developing control systems or logic with fully or partially self-evolving behavior, that are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, additional requirements have been added into the EHSRs in Annex III. They shall not cause the machinery or related product to perform actions beyond their defined task and movement space. Recording of data on the safety related decision-making process for software-based safety systems ensuring safety functions must be enabled and retained for one year after the machinery or related product is place on to the market or put into service. At all times it must be possible to correct the machinery or related product in order to maintain its inherent safety. 8The Machinery Regulation (EU) PG 2Key Dates PG 3Re-ordering of the annexes PG 4Substantial Modifications PG 9Compliance Route/ Fines & Penalties PG 10OEM - Call to Action PG 11Further Information PG 12 Substantial modifications – explanation of Article 3 (16) After being placed on the market or put into service, should machinery be modified, by physical or digital means (meaning hardware or software), in a way that is not foreseen by the manufacturer, and which affects the safety of such products by creating a new hazard or increasing an existing risk, the modification should be considered as substantial when significant new protective measures are required . The person that carries out the substantial modification should be required to perform a new conformity assessment before placing the modified product on the market or putting it into service. This conformity assessment can be restricted to the part of the production line that has been modified, and so does not have to be completed for the whole assembly. Five Steps to Improving Safety Maturity PG 2The RA Safety Maturity Improvement Process PG 6Step One PG 7Step Two PG 11Step Three PG 13Step Four PG 15Step Five PG 20 9The Machinery Regulation (EU) PG 2Key Dates PG 3Re-ordering of the annexes PG 4Substantial Modifications PG 9Compliance Route/ Fines & Penalties PG 10OEM - Call to Action PG 11Further Information PG 12 Compliance Route There is more emphasis in the regulation for third-party certification. However, self- certification is still possible as long as the machinery is in Annex I Part B and is built preferably using harmonized standards or a common specification. If the machinery is not in Annex I, the preferred route is to follow harmonized standards. The compliance route for this type of equipment is in Annex VI module A. For all other equipment, third-party certification through a notified body is required. The route to compliance is covered in Annexes VII VIII & IX of the Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/12302. 2 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R1230 Fines & Penalties Article 50 empowers member states to define the exact size of the fines and penalties against the Machinery Regulations (EU) 2023/1230. Although not yet confirmed it is expected that these will aligned with other recent directives, such as the Network & Information Security Directive (NIS2) which can impose fines of up to €10,000,000 or 2% of global annual revenue.
